## Design Choices

- Modern & Minimal Layout – I used a clean white background with blue as the primary color to keep the design professional and aligned with an academic brand.

- Tailwind CSS – I chose Tailwind for fast development and easy responsiveness without writing a lot of custom CSS.

- Mobile-First Approach – The layout is designed to look good on small screens first, then expanded for desktop using Tailwind’s responsive utilities.
