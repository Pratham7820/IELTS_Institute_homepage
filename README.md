## Design Choices (Sample Note)

- Modern & Minimal Layout â€“ I used a clean white background with blue as the primary color to keep the design professional and aligned with an academic brand.

- Tailwind CSS â€“ I chose Tailwind for fast development and easy responsiveness without writing a lot of custom CSS.

- Mobile-First Approach â€“ The layout is designed to look good on small screens first, then expanded for desktop using Tailwindâ€™s responsive utilities.
